                Four week long C++ coursework project. Developed a 3D physics-driven game featuring AI,
                networking and collision detection. An initial codebase was provided via tutorial documents,
                and the expectation is to extend each section of the game to be more functional and useful.
                <br><br>
                Key features:<br><br>

                                 <b>• Physics & Collisions</b><br>
                Implemented rigid-body physics for AABB and sphere collision shapes, including collision detection and resolution.<br>
                Integrated the physics system into gameplay via bonuses and a rope-bridge.<br>
                Position constraints, implemented in the form of a rope bridge. <br />
                <br>
                <b>• AI</b><br>
                Created a state-based enemy AI that can switch between patrolling and chasing.<br>
                Grid-based A* algorithm implementation.<br>
                Raycasting for line-of-sight.<br>
                <br>
                <b>• Multiplayer Networking</b><br>
                Implemented a client-server model for multiplayer capabilities.<br>
                Designed a system to see connected client's current score.<br>
                Real-time position updates across the network.<br>
                <br>
                <b>• Game Design & UI</b><br>
                UI system that uses pushdown automata to keep track of it's state.<br>
                Maze generation, using data from a file and collectibles and bonuses scattered randomly.<br>
                Win/Loss system with the ability to reload the world<br>
