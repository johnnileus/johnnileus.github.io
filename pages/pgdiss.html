    <h2>Agent & Chunk based City Generation</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      This project, developed for my MSc in Game Engineering, tackles the challenge of generating large and performant cities in real time.
      The goal was to research and develop chunk-based algorithms capable of producing infinite cities.

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <p>Using Unity and C#, I designed and implemented three algorithms to explore the different trade-offs between performance and visuals.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Agent-Based Generator:</strong>
        A conventional road generator that simulates organic growth to serve as a baseline for visual quality,
        generating natural and meandering road networks.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <strong>Grid-Based Chunk Generator:</strong>
        Generates a road network aligned to a grid and within individual chunks, optimised for speed.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <strong>Voronoi-Based Chunk Generator:</strong>
        A modified algorithm of the previous generator, using Voronoi cells to randomise the shape of each chunk and produce
        more natural, organic cells. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A pipeline was created to translate these 2D road networks into 3D geometry, including roads and extruded building footprints.</p>
