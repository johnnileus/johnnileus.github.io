            <h2>Multiplayer Card Game</h2>
            <br>
            <p>This project is a multiplayer card game, taking slight inspiration from UNO, developed from the ground up using pygame and sockets.
            This was my first large-scale project, having created it during my first year of A-Levels as a practise project for my upcoming NEA. It implements networking and game logic in a way
            I had not done before.</p>

            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <p></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I built the client-server architecture using Python's socket library, and the pickle library to serialise and transmit any game states
                    between clients.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    All game rules and the central game state are managed on the server, which prevents cheating and ensures every player's game is synchronised
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Pygame was used to render the visual elements, including player hands, the discard pile and other UI components, as well as managing player input.
                </li>
            </ul>
