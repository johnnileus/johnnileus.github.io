            <h2>Dungeon Crawler Rogue-like Personal Project</h2>
            <br>
            <p>

                During the summer after my second year, I took on the challenge of developing my first game in Unity
                to get some experience with it for some upcoming modules. In the end I chose to create a roguelike
                dungeon-crawler. Throughout the process I implemented some interesting features including an inventory
                system, unique combat mechanics and procedural dungeon generation.</br></br>

                <b> • INVENTORY SYSTEM </b></br>
                To handle inventory management, I designed a system that allowed for stackable items
                and the ability to drag these between slots. This required implementing a number of combinations for
                all possible item combinations and stack counts for both left and right-click actions, including
                overflowing stacks and picking up a stack too big from the ground.</br></br>

                Each item in the game has a set of base stats which are stored in a scriptable object, and when spawned
                in the world, a unique percentage modifier is added to this to create a unique weapon each time. A weapon
                with an attack of 3 and a +20% bonus would result in a 3.6 attack.</br></br>

                As well as this, equippable items such as weapons each have their own unique attacks which can be assigned
                individually, with five different projectiles currently implemented. The attack takes in the item's unique
                attack damage and speed and changes how the attack behaves accordingly.</br></br></br>

                <b> • COMBAT MECHANICS</b></br>
                For enemies to fight, I implemented a basic enemy with a health bar and which uses a row of icicle attacks
                at the player, animated using Unity's animation controller. This system is simple, but has the ability to
                be expanded easily.</br></br>

                I wanted to experiment with a unique health bar system. Instead of a standard
                bar I implemented one that is subdivided into segments, where healing only restores up to the next division.
                While this was a simple implementation, it opened the door for additional mechanics such as poison attacks
                rather than reducing a fixed number of hit points.</br></br></br>

                <b> • DUNGEON GENERATION</b></br>
                To generate the dungeon layout, I used a modified version of Prim's algorithm to create a randomised
                grid-based maze. I kept track of all active and frontier cells, expanding the dungeon by connecting a
                randomly chosen frontier cell to an existing active neighbour. Repeating this until all cells are visited
                created an unpredictable loop-free maze.</br></br>

                For room placement, I designed a system that generated rooms dynamically and categorised them into five
                groups based on their entrance configuration. Instead of creating seperate prefabs for each type of entrance
                combination, it was possible to combine some into the same prefab and just rotate it. A north+east room is
                the same as an east+south room, just rotated 90 degrees. Corridor prefabs are also created to make a gap
                between room entrances.</br></br>

                The dungeon also includes a boss room, which is generated at the furthest away point from the beginning cell
                and is kept track of as the dungeon is generated. When the player reaches this room, they're teleported to a
                seperate arena. Enemies are generated randomly within each room, and prevent the player from progressing past
                that room without killing every enemy.</br></br>
