            <h2>Dungeon Crawler Rogue-like Personal Project</h2>
            <br>
            <p>During a summer project, I developed a roguelike dungeon-crawler in Unity.
                The game features a dynamic inventory system, unique combat mechanics,
                and procedural dungeon generation. While the project is clearly unfinished, it taught me
                a lot of new skills that I put towards future projects.
                </p>

            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Dynamic Inventory &amp; Items:</strong>
                    Created a robust inventory system that supports
                    drag-and-drop management and item stacking, including
                    handling all edge cases like stack overflows. Items are
                    generated from scriptable objects, with randomized stat
                    modifiers applied at spawn to create unique loot. Equippable
                    weapons have distinct, assignable attack patterns that scale
                    with the item's final damage and speed stats.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Segmented Health &amp; Combat:</strong> 
                    To create more strategic gameplay, I implemented a non-traditional
                    , segmented health bar. Healing only restores the current
                    segment, not the full bar, which opens the door for interesting other mechanics.
                    The system includes expandable enemy types with unique animated attack patterns.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Procedural Dungeon Generation:</strong> 
                    The dungeon layout is a randomized, loop-free maze generated using
                    a modified version of <strong>Prim's algorithm</strong>. Rooms are 
                    placed dynamically from a set of prefabs that are rotated to fit the
                    required entrance configurations. Enemies spawn in each room, and 
                    the boss room is strategically placed at the furthest point from the
                    start to create a final challenge.
                </li>
            </ul>
