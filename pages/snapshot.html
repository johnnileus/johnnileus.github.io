            <h2>Snapshot</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I organised a <a href="https://itch.io/jam/game-dev-winter-jam-25"> game jam</a> for my MSc peers and myself during some downtime before an upcoming team project, which I entered
            with a team of three. We developed a first-person puzzle game built around a unique 'camera flash' mechanic.</p>
            
            <hr>
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <p>The game was developed in Godot to learn the engine, as none of the team had used it previously.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Beyond organising the jam itself, I led the development for the team. I was responsible for defining scope and delegating tasks
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    I designed and built the game's level, with my focus on creating a strong atmosphere. Added ambient sound, particle effects and lighting.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    I also programmed the camera and its flash mechanic, creating a flash that persists after the snapshot is taken. 
                </li>
            </ul>
